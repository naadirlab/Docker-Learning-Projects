# Docker Learning Projects

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Docker and containerized applications. It contains multiple small projects.

## Repository Overview

Each project is stored in its own folder and has its own README with explanations and notes.

- hello-flask-app/
- flask-redis-app/
- node-app-dockerhub/
- more may be added...

## What I Built

Several containerized applications using Docker and Docker Compose:
- A Flask app with MySQL
- A Flask app with Redis and Nginx
- A Node.js (Express) app using multi-stage Docker builds

## My Approach
- Start with simple applications (Flask or Node.js)
- Connect to a Database (MySQL, Redis)
- Containerize each app using Dockerfiles
- Multi-container setups with Docker Compose
- Nginx as a reverse proxy / load balancer
- Multi-stage builds to reduce image size
- Document every step clearly so it can be followed again.

## What I Learned
- How Docker images and containers work
- Writing and optimizing Dockerfiles
- Using Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications
- Networking between containers
- Persisting data with Docker volumes
- Scaling services and using Nginx as a load balancer
- Pushing and managing images on Docker Hub

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to learn Docker by building real working examples and share my Learnings with others.
